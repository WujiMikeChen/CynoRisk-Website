                <strong>Credit risk management in the banking book</strong>
            </p>
            <p>
                In Canada (and most of other countries), the largest risk exposure banks
                are subject to is credit risk, roughly accounting for 90% of total
                quantifiable risks as evidenced by banks capital disclosure (Table 1).
                The major contribution of credit risk is from the banking book, which are
                assets on the balance sheet that are expected to be held to maturity. In
                the banking book the wholesale portfolio is usually comprised of
                businesses, sovereigns, public sector entities, banks and other financial
                institutions, as well as certain high net value individuals. The retail
                portfolio is comprised of residential mortgages, personal loans, credit
                cards, and small business loans.
            </p>
            <p>
                Credit risk is quantified at both the individual obligor and portfolio
                levels to manage expected credit losses and minimize unexpected losses to
                limit earning volatility and ensure that the bank is adequately
                capitalized. Unexpected loss for at pre-determined confidence internal is
                used to measure capital requirement. Expected loss for credit products are
                often referred to as allowance for credit loss (AOL) in accounting.
            </p>
            <p>
                At the bank level, there are three pillars to manage credit risk, which are
                economic and regulatory capital, stress testing, and credit provisioning.
                In this paper, we will focus on the latter two, which have been playing a
                central role in managing the credit risk during the pandemic.

                <strong>The Stress Testing Framework</strong>
            </p>
            <p>
                The concept of stress testing was introduced by the Basel Committee on
                Banking Supervision (BCBS) in Pillar 2 of Basel II capital framework in
                2005. According to BCBS, “a stress test is commonly described as the
                evaluation of the financial position of a bank under a severe but plausible
                scenario to assist in decision making within the bank” [1,2].
            </p>
            <p>
                In Canada, the Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions
                Canada (OSFI) E-18 (Stress Testing) required stress testing exercises as an
                integrated component of the sound business and financial practices [3].
                OSFI E-19 (Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process (ICAAP) for
                Deposit-Taking Institutions) emphasized that the rigorous and
                forward-looking stress testing should be incorporated in the capital
                planning process to identify possible adverse events or changes in market
                conditions [4]. Macro Stress Test (MST) is an OSFI prescribed stress
                scenario on forward looking macro-economic conditions, and banks are
                required to report a set of risk measures under this scenario including
                those mentioned previously such as PCL level for credit risk, CET1 ratio
                for regulatory capital and liquidity coverage and net stable funding ratio
                for liquidity risk.
            </p>
            <p>
                Stress testing includes both scenario testing and sensitivity testing, as
                shown in Figure 1. Hypothetical stress scenario of macro-economic and
                financial variables such as GDP, CPI, unemployment rate, house price index,
                commodity price, stock market volatility, securities yield spread and
                interest rate, etc., are designed. The stress testing scenarios evaluates
                global recessions, equity market corrections, elevated debt levels, trade
                policies, changes in interest rates, real estate price corrections, and
                shocks to credit spreads and commodity markets, among other factors. The
                latest developments in macro-economic environment, such as pandemic,
                geo-political tension, inflation risk, supply chain pressures as well as
                physical and transitional climate risk are also incorporated in the stress
                testing.
            </p>
            <p>
                Given credit rating (could be internally assessed), banks use the scenario
                to update their models for Probability of Default (PD) estimate, which
                regresses on those scenarios. Loss Given Default (LGD) are typically
                impacted by the value of the collateral under the scenario. Exposure at
                Default (EAD) estimates will consider the increased drawn down on approved
                limit during the stressed period.
            </p>
            <p>
                The process of stress scenarios used for capital planning at RBC is shown
                in Figure 2. The stress scenarios are evaluated across the organization,
                and results are integrated to develop an enterprise-wide view of financial
                impacts and capital requirements, which in turn facilitate the planning of
                mitigating actions to absorb adverse events.

                <strong>The Credit Provisioning Framework</strong>
            </p>
            <p>
                Under the IFRS 9 accounting standard which was effective on November 1,
                2017 for Canadian banks, allowance for credit losses (ACL) represents
                expected credit losses (ECLs) on financial assets in the banking book
                [5,6]. The allowance is increased by the provision for credit losses (PCL),
                decreased by write-offs net of recoveries and disposals, and impacted by
                foreign exchange. (PCL) is the amount charged to income necessary to bring
                the allowance for credit losses to a level determined appropriate by
                management. This includes provisions on performing and impaired financial
                assets.
            </p>
            <p>
                ACL is computed according to a three-stage expected credit loss impairment
                model:
            </p>
            <p id="subtitle">
                Performing financial assets
            </p>
            <p>
                • Stage 1 – From initial recognition of a financial asset to the date on
                which the asset has experienced a significant increase in credit risk
                relative to its initial recognition, a loss allowance is recognized equal
                to the credit losses expected to result from defaults occurring over the 12
                months following the reporting date.
            </p>
            <p>
                • Stage 2 – Following a significant increase in credit risk relative to the
                initial recognition of the financial asset, a loss allowance is recognized
                equal to the credit losses expected over the remaining lifetime of the
                asset.
            </p>
            <p id="subtitle">
                Impaired financial assets
            </p>
            <p>
                • Stage 3 – When a financial asset is considered to be credit-impaired, a
                loss allowance is recognized equal to credit losses expected over the
                remaining lifetime of the asset. Interest income is calculated based on the
                carrying amount of the asset, net of the loss allowance, rather than on its
                gross carrying amount.
            </p>
            <p>
                The PD, LGD and EAD inputs used to estimate Stage 1 and Stage 2 credit loss
                allowances are modelled based on the macroeconomic and financial variables.
                Several (usually 3 or 5) distinct scenarios are designed to capture a wide
                range of possible outcomes (base, downside, and upside) and are then
                weighted according to the relative likelihood of the scenarios. Similar to
                stress testing, the scenarios are based on forward looking macroeconomic
                and financial variables.

                The Canada unemployment rate projection by RBC is shown in Figure 3. In the
                base forecast, Canada unemployment rate is expected to rise to 5.6% in Q4,
                2022, peaking by Q4 2023 at 6.8%, and reverting to the long run equilibrium
                towards the latter end of the forecast horizon.

                    Challenges of Stress Testing and Credit Provisioning during the
                    pandemic
                </strong>
            </p>
            <p>
                Both stress testing and ECL models rely on macroeconomic and financial
                variables as inputs, with the parameters calibrated to historical data up
                to 20 years. When in Q1 2020 the Covid-19 pandemic shut down businesses
                and erased millions of jobs almost overnight and then followed by massive
                fiscal stimulus from governments, the projected GDP could be down up to 30%
                and unemployment rate could be up to 50%, which has never been happened
                before. Based on these scenarios and calibrated parameters via historical
                data, all obligors would essentially default, leading to huge losses. The
                stimulus and other stability measures in response to challenges posed by
                Covid-19 break the boundaries of any model that was built based on
                pre-pandemic data.
            </p>
            <p>
                Nevertheless, the banks had to change the model and post a significant
                increase in PCLs. In Q2 2020, RBC recorded a PCL of 2.8Bn (vs. 400MM in
                Q1), TD 3.2Bn (vs. 900MM in Q1), Scotia Bank 1.8Bn (vs. 936MM), CIBC 1.4Bn
                (vs. 261MM in Q1), BMO 1.1Bn (vs. 176MM in Q1).
            </p>
            <p>
                It turns out that the banks have overestimated PCL. The new credit models
                failed to take into account government support measures and overpredicted
                losses for companies that were financially strong, even in troubled
                sectors, because of sector/rating based projected PD and LGD.
            </p>
            <p>
                The PCL were revised down over the course of 2021, as some major economies
                bounced back. However, it is debatable, because the same stress model would
                predict a too low PD, with pandemic scenarios were taken into account.
                Entering 2021, the stress testing and ECL model have new challenges of high
                inflation and high interest rates, which are all outside of the historical
                data calibration window. RBC’s quarterly PCL from 2019 to 2020 is shown in
                Figure 4, reflecting the challenges of both changing macroeconomic
                environments and credit model performance.
            </p>
            <p>
                In Q4, 2022, PCL has increased substantially again, as banks factored in
                more pessimistic macroeconomic outlooks, featured by a possible recession,
                high interest rate, and high inflation. Aggregated PCL for six major banks
                increased to 2.3Bn during Q4, 2022 from 1.5Bn in Q3 [7].
