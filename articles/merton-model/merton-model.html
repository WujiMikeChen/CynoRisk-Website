            </h1>
            <p>
                In this paper, we review the literature on the structured credit modeling
                and its latest development and applications in the risk management and risk
                capital charges. The Merton model and other asset process based structured
                credit models are presented in three application fields, which are PD
                models, PD projection models, and default correlation models. Two latest
                Merton model industry applications, climate transition risk and DRC IMA
                model in FRTB, are discussed. <a name="_Hlk120910035"></a>

                <strong>1. Introduction</strong>
            </h1>
            <p>
                Credit risk, which is the risk that an obligor does not honor his payment
                obligation, is the most important and the material risk in the financial
                system. The credit risk is measured at both the individual obligor and
                portfolio levels, with the most important measurements being the
                probability of default (PD), loss given default (LGD) and exposure at
                default (EAD); and default correlation. Credit risk models can be divided
                into two main classes: structural and reduced form models. Structural
                models are used to calculate probability of default based on the value of
                its assets and liabilities. In the reduced form model, or default
                intensity models, the default of an obligor is modelled as a Poisson
                process.
            </p>
            <p>
                The first structural model was proposed by Merton in 1974 [1]. In the
                Merton model a company’s equity is modelled as an option on the assets of
                the company. It provides a way of relating credit risk to the capital
                structure of a firm and the probably of default can be computed via
                Black-Sholes-Merton option valuation model.
            </p>
            <p>
                The concept of modeling credit risk via a call option of an asset process
                has been expanded and become fundamental in credit risk modeling with the
                applications in asset pricing, risk capital charges (from Basel 2 to Basel
                4), PD projection and stress testing and credit provisioning in accounting
                (IFRS 9), climate change transition risks.
            </p>
            <p>
                The paper is organized as follows: in Section 2, the Merton model is
                introduced. In Section 3, the extension of the Merton model and their
                applications in three fields: 1) implied PD and migration model like Moody’s
                KMV and CreditMetrics (section 3.1), PD projection models with application
                in stress testing and IFRS 9 are discussed (Section 3.2), and default
                correlation models with application with applications in credit portfolio
                management (Section 3.3). In the Section 4, the latest development of the
                application of structured credit model in modeling climate risk and Default
                Risk Charge (DRC) Internal Model Approach (IMA) in Fundamental Review of
                the Trading Book (FRTB) are discussed. A multi-factor default correlation
                model that are in compliance with FRTB requirements is presented.

                <strong>2. The Merton Model</strong>
            </h1>
            <p>
                In 1974, Merton proposed a model where a company’s equity is an option on
                the assets o the company. Assuming a simple capital structure of a firm is:
            </p>
            <p>
                \( A = Equities+Liabilities = S + B \quad [1] \)


            </p>
            <p>
                The firm is limited liability firm. Assume that at time T, the firm
                (equity) will be faced with a payment obligation of D. If the firm’s value
                is less than the payment obligation, equity will declare bankrupt of the
                firm. The key assumption of the Merton model is that both equity and debt
                can be viewed as derivative securities on the value A, with the following
                payoff
            </p>
            <p>
                \(B(A,t) = \min(D, A), \quad S(A,t) = \max(A - D, 0) \quad [2] \)
            </p>
            <p>
                The value of assets A is assumed to follow a log-normal diffusion process
                that is under the physical probability measure:
            </p>
            <p>
                \(dA = \mu A dt + \sigma A dW(t) \quad [3] \)
            </p>
            <p>
                where W(t) is the standard Brownian motion, m is the instantaneous expected
                return on assets, σ is the constant proportional volatility of the return
                on the firm value. Following the standard Black-Scholes-Merton pricing
                theory, we can solve it via an PDE approach. The firm defaults if A&lt;D.
                The PD of the firm can be computed as:
            </p>
            <p>
                \(PD(T) = \mathbb{P}(A(T) < D)=\Phi\left( \frac{\ln(D / A(t)) - \left(\mu - 0.5 \sigma^2\right)(T -
                    t)}{\sigma \sqrt{T - t}} \right) \quad [4] \) </p>
                    <p>
                        The concept of the Merton model, in which PD is option (with strike D) on
                        its asset value, can be illustrated in the figure below.

                        <strong>3. Extensions and applications of the Merton Model</strong>
                    </h1>
                    <p>
                        The simplicity of the Merton model relies on applying the
                        Black-Scholes-Merton formula of pricing the European options to value
                        firm’s equity and debt. However, this comes at the cost of too simplistic
                        assumptions regarding the asset value process, interest rate, and the
                        capital structure. Since the Merton model was developed, there has been
                        many efforts to improve the model, which has been proved to be challenging.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        However, the concept of the Merton model has become fundamental to the
                        credit risk modeling and has found many applications in the financial
                        industry. Three major industry application of the structured credit model
                        is discussed in this section.
                    </p>
                    <h1>
                        <strong>3.1 The implied PD and credit migration models</strong>
                    </h1>
                    <p>
                        The structured credit model, which has a widespread practical usage, is
                        Moody’s KMV model [2]. There are few changes made to the Merton model in
                        the KMV model. First, Instead of the Gaussian distribution, the EDF in KMV
                        model is replaced by some decreasing function that is empirically
                        estimated; Secondly the liabilities is replaced by one that better reflects
                        the firm’s liabilities.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        An important quantity of the KMV model is the so-called distance to default
                        (DD):
                    </p>
                    <p>\( \text{DD} = \frac{\ln\left( \frac{A(t)}{D} \right) + (r - 0.5\sigma^2)(T - t)}{\sigma \sqrt{T
                        - t}} \quad [5] \)</p>

                    <p>
                        Another widely used structured credit model in the industry is the one
                        proposed by CreditMetrics [3], in which both default and credit quality,
                        measured by rating, are linked to the firm’s asset value, as shown in Figure
                        2. The PD and migration can be modeled as
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        \( PD(Default) = \mathbb{P}(A < X_{Def})=\Phi\left( \frac{X_{Def}}{\sigma} \right) \quad [6] \)
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                \( PD(CCC) = \mathbb{P}(X_{Def} < A < X_{CCC})=\Phi\left( \frac{X_{CCC}}{\sigma} \right)
                                    - \Phi\left( \frac{X_{Def}}{\sigma} \right) \quad [7] \) </p>
                                    <p>
                                        It can be used to model both rating migration and default risk, which is
                                        required in the Incremental Risk Charge (IRC) in Basel 2.5 [4] and
                                        valuation/risk/capital model in Credit Valuation Adjustment (CVA). The
                                        model can also be used for credit derivatives pricing (For example, see [5,
                                        6]).
                                    </p>

                                        PD (and migration) projection under various macroeconomic and financial
                                        scenarios has important applications in credit risk research [7], stress
                                        testing, and credit provisioning for credit portfolio (IFR9) [8]. The basic
                                        model is based on linear regression, which is calibrated to the historical
                                        data of default rate and macroeconomic and financial variables. The
                                        calibrated regression parameters are then used to forecast PD with given
                                        scenarios, as shown in Figure 3.

                                        needs to be converted to a standardized asset process in the Merton
                                        framework and then put into a regression model as follows:
                                    </p>

                                        Default correlation measures whether credit risky assets are more likely to
                                        default together or separately. It is essential for estimating the risk of
                                        credit portfolios. For the credit derivatives with multiple assets as the
                                        underlying asset pool like Collateral Debt Obligation (CDO), correlation
                                        risk is the major risk factor, which are captured via default correlation
                                        models such as the normal copula model.

                                        One latest application of Merton type model is to model climate-related
                                        transition risk. A Merton framework is used to link the climate transition
                                        scenarios to credit risk, which is measured by PDs for sector/segment and
                                        geography. A detailed description of the model can be found in Ref. [11].

                                        Another latest development is DRC IMA model in FRTB. FRTB is the new

                                        by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS) in the years following

                                        DRC captures the default risk of any exposure to credit risk, replacing
                                        current IRC models in Basel 2.5. DRC IMA is measured using a Value-at-Risk
                                        (VaR) model. A multi-factor Monte Carlo simulation model over one-year time

                                Weights related to base (country(region)/industry) factors can be assigned
                                based on revenue or discretional decisions.

                                Following Basel guidelines, default correlation is computed based on
                                historical credit spreads and listed equity prices. Sector definitions need
                                to be based on the bank’s exposure. For a typical global bank, we can have
                                over 10 industry sectors, one government, and one municipal sector. The
                                global factor also serves the purpose of computing PD-LGD correlation. LGD
                                is simulated via a beta distribution.
